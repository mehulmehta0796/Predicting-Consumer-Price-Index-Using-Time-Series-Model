# Context
The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is a measure that examines the weighted average of prices of a basket of consumer goods and services, such as transportation, food, and medical care. It is calculated by taking price changes for each item in the predetermined basket of goods and averaging them. Changes in the CPI are used to assess price changes associated with the cost of living.

# About the Project
The CPI attempts to quantify and measure the average cost-of-living in a given country by estimating the purchasing power of a single unit of currency. Therefore, it is the key macroeconomic indicator for measuring inflation (or deflation). As such, the CPI is a major driving force in the economy influencing a plethora of market dynamics. The project present a novel model based on Time Series Analysis for forecasting CPI.
