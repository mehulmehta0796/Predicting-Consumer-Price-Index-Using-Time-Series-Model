# Predicting-Consumer-Price-Index-Using-Time-Series-Model
The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is a measure of the average change over time in the prices paid by a representative consumer for a common basket of goods and services. The CPI attempts to quantify and measure the average cost-of-living in a given country by estimating the purchasing power of a single unit of currency. Therefore, it is the key macroeconomic indicator for measuring inflation (or deflation). As such, the CPI is a major driving force in the economy influencing a plethora of market dynamics. In this project, I present a novel model based on Time Series Analysis for forecasting CPI.
